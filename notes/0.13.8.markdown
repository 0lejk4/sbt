### Improvements

- Discovered main classes will be sorted. [#1180][1180] by [@kretes][@kretes]
- Implemented a new mechanism of forking javac, whereby errors are captured.  Also more likely to run in-process. [#1702][1702] by [@jsuereth][@jsuereth]
- Adds project-level dependency exclusions. See below.

### Fixes

- Javac warnings are treated as warnings.  [#1702][1702]/[#875][875] by [@jsuereth][@jsuereth]
- `compilerReporter` is fed to javac during incremental compilation. [#1542][1542] by [@jsuereth][@jsuereth]
- Ignores hidden build files from the build. [#1746][1746] by [@j-keck][@j-keck]
- Fixes build.sbt parsing of multiple import. [#1741][1741] by [@ajozwik][@ajozwik]
- Fixes ANSI escape code for overwriting lines on Windows. [#1771][1771] by [@dwickern][@dwickern]

### Project-level dependency exclusions

sbt 0.13.8 adds project-level dependency exclusions:

    excludeDependencies += "org.apache.logging.log4j"
    excludeDependencies += "com.example" %% "foo"

In the first example, all artifacts from the organization `"org.apache.logging.log4j"` are excluded from the managed dependency.
In the second example, artifacts with the organization `"com.example"` and the name `"foo"` cross versioned to the current `scalaVersion` are excluded. [#1748][1748] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]
