### Consolidated resolution

sbt 0.13.6 adds a new setting key called `updateOptions`, which can be used to enable consolidated resolution for `update` task.

    updateOptions := updateOptions.value.withConsolidatedResolution(true)

This feature is specifically targeted to address [Ivy resolution is beging slow for multi-module projects #413][413]. Consolidated resolution aims to fix this issue by artificially constructing an Ivy dependency graph for the unique managed dependencies. If two subprojects introduce identical external dependencies, both subprojects should consolidate to the same graph, and therefore resolve immediately for the second `update`. [#1454][1454]
