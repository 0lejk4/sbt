### Improvements and bug fixes to the new startup messages

The two new startup messages introduced in sbt 0.13.15 are:

- when writing out `sbt.version`, for build reproducability, and
- when informing the user about sbt's shell, for the performance improvement

When writing out `sbt.version` the messaging now:

- correctly uses a logger rather than println
- honours the log level set, for instance by `--error`
- never executes when sbt "new" is being run

When informing the user about sbt's shell the messaging now:

- is a 1 line message, rather than 3
- is at info level, rather than warn level
- can be suppressed with `suppressSbtShellNotification := true`
- only triggers when `compile` is being run
- never shows when sbt `new` is being run

### sbt-cross-building

[@jrudolph][@jrudolph]'s sbt-cross-building is a plugin author's plugin.
It adds cross command `^` and sbtVersion switch command `^^`, similar to `+` and `++`,
but for switching between multiple sbt versions across major versions.
sbt 0.13.16 merges these commands into sbt because the feature it provides is useful as we migrate plugins to sbt 1.0.

To switch the `sbtVersion in pluginCrossBuild` from the shell use:

```
^^ 1.0.0-M5
```

Your plugin will now build with sbt 1.0.0-M5 (and its Scala version 2.12.2).

If you need to make changes specific to a sbt version, you can now include them into `src/main/scala-sbt-0.13`,
and `src/main/scala-sbt-1.0.0-M5`, where the binary sbt version number is used as postfix.

To run a command across multiple sbt versions, set:

```scala
crossSbtVersions := Vector("0.13.15", "1.0.0-M5")
```

Then, run:

```
^ compile
```
