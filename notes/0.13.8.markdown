### Improvements

- Discovered main classes are now sorted. [#1180][1180] by [@kretes][@kretes]
- Implemented a new mechanism of forking javac, whereby errors are captured.  Also more likely to run in-process. [#1702][1702] by [@jsuereth][jsuereth]
- Adds project-level dependency exclusions. See below.

## Fixes

- Javac warnings now always treated as warnings.  [#1702][1702]/[#875][875] by [@jsuereth][jsuereth]
- compilerReporter now fed to javac during incremental compilation. [#1542][1542] by [@jsuereth][jsuereth]
- ignore hidden build files from the build. [#1746][1746] by [@j-keck][@j-keck]

## Project-level dependency exclusions

sbt 0.13.8 adds project-level dependency exclusions:

    excludeDependencies += "org.apache.logging.log4j"
    excludeDependencies += "com.example" %% "foo"

In the first example, all artifacts from the organization `"org.apache.logging.log4j"` are excluded from the managed dependency.
In the second example, artifacts with the organization `"com.example"` and the name `"foo"` cross versioned to the current `scalaVersion` are excluded.
