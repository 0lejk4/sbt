# The tests/fork-parallel test will currently always 
# report success when run on less than four cores,
# rather than  failing in one of the two cases as expected.
# TODO: Adjust this scripted test so that it works as
# intended on less than four cores as well.

# To debug, it is possible to limit the number of cores
# reported to sbt, and run the test, by using:
#   taskset 0x00000003 sbt 'scripted tests/fork-parallel'
# See: https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/3545

# This bit won't currently work when using less than four cores.
# > test
# -> check

> clean
> set testForkedParallel := true
